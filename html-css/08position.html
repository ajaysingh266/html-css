          <p>The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written
            in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, 
            and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was 
            the original paragraphs, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[2] The Greek parágraphos 
            evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline 
            between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.</p>

            <p>Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution
                In ancient manuscripts, another mean to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break 
                (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital 
                letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original 
                Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[3] 
                Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen 
                in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other 
                symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.</p>
